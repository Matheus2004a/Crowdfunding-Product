## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) the platform to challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the challenge

Your challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Make a selection of which pledge to make
- See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
- See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge
- Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design. 

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information you'll need, as color palette and fonts.

**Let's give our best day after day!** ðŸš€
